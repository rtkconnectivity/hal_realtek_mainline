# Realtek MPCli Tool Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files required for flashing **essential system images** (such as Bootloader patches, System patches, and Configuration files) to Realtek Bee series SoCs using the Realtek MPCli tool integration in Zephyr.

These JSON files are used by the `west flash` command to define the memory layout and the location of the binary blobs.
